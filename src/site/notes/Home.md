# Principles

1. **Use a model based approach** - the aim of this is to build and learn a latticework of mental models. As such concepts should be written with the aim of framing them as a reusable mental model. 
2. **Notes should be appropriately sized** - large enough to be useful, but not so large they cannot be remembered.
3. **Quality over quantity** - focus on a smaller number of useful models than a larger number of notes you will lose control over. Don't fall into the 'collector's fallacy'.
4. **Long term knowledge only** - no To Dos, meetings notes or transient information belong here.
5. **Minimum configuration** - keep plugin usage to a minimum. Don't fall into the trap of configuring the tool over the notes.
